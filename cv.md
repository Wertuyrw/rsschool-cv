**Sentence Smash from Codewars**

Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word
```
function smash (words) {
   return words.join(' ');
};

const wordsArray = ["Hello", "world", "this", "is", "a", "test"];
const sentence = smash(wordsArray);
